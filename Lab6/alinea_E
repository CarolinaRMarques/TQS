Issue -> Problem Description -> How to Solve

Bug	-> "Random" objects should be reused -> For better efficiency and randomness, create a single Random, then store, and reuse it. 
	rand = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong();  // SecureRandom is preferred to Random  
	public void doSomethingCommon() {  
	int rValue = this.rand.nextInt();   //...
	
Code Smell(Critical) -> Constant names should comply with a naming convention  ->  Rename this constant name to match the regular expression '^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*(_[A-Z0-9]+)*$'.

	public class MyClass {
	  public static final int FIRST = 1;
	}

	public enum MyEnum {
	  FIRST;
	}
		
Code Smell(Major) -> "for" loop stop conditions should be invariant -> Refactor the code in order to not assign to this loop counter from within the loop body.  

	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {...}

Code Smell (Major) -> Unused method parameters should be removed -> Remove this unused method parameter "subset" 

Code Smell (Major) -> Standard outputs should not be used directly to log anything -> Replace this use of System.out or System.err by a logger.
	logger.log("My Message");
